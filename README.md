An advanced AI system that simulates child development through neural networks and psychological modeling.

## Version 1.1.0

### Features

- ðŸ§  Dynamic Neural Architecture
  - Flexible input/output dimension handling
  - Adaptive psychological components
  - Backward compatibility with older checkpoints

- ðŸŒ± Developmental Stages
  - Progressive learning from newborn to mature adult
  - Stage-appropriate interactions and behaviors
  - Milestone tracking and achievement system

- ðŸ’­ Psychological Components
  - Attachment System with adaptive bonding
  - Defense Mechanisms for emotional regulation
  - Theory of Mind for social understanding
  - Emotional state modeling and progression

- ðŸ“Š Interactive Interface
  - Real-time development tracking
  - Emotional state visualization
  - Progress metrics and analytics
  - Checkpoint management system

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-child.git
cd neural-child
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Usage

1. **Interaction**: Use the interface to interact with the child through various developmental stages.
2. **Development**: Monitor progress through milestones and stage transitions.
3. **Analysis**: Track emotional development and cognitive growth.
4. **Checkpoints**: Save and load development states at any point.

### State Management

The system now supports flexible state management:
- Automatic checkpoint saving
- Backward compatibility with older models
- Graceful handling of architecture changes
- Preservation of developmental progress

### Development Stages

1. **Newborn** (0-3 months)
   - Basic reflexes and emotional responses
   - Primary caregiver recognition

2. **Early Infancy** (3-6 months)
   - Social smiling and cooing
   - Object tracking and reaching
