- Milestone tracking
- Stage transitions
- Developmental metrics

### 3. Psychological Components
Interconnected systems modeling psychological development:

#### Attachment System (`attachment.py`)
- Relationship modeling
- Bonding patterns
- Social interaction processing
- Attachment style development

#### Theory of Mind (`theory_of_mind.py`)
- Social understanding
- Perspective taking
- Belief modeling
- Intention recognition

#### Emotional Regulation (`emotional_regulation.py`)
- Emotion processing
- Response modulation
- Coping strategies
- Affect management

### 4. Learning Systems

#### Training System (`training_system.py`)
- Core learning algorithms
- Parameter updates
- Loss computation
- Optimization

#### Autonomous Learning (`autonomous_learner.py`)
- Self-directed exploration
- Curiosity-driven learning
- Skill acquisition
- Knowledge building

#### Memory System (`memory_module.py`)
- Experience storage
- Memory consolidation
- Retrieval mechanisms
- Pattern recognition
