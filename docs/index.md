# Neural Child Development System Documentation

Welcome to the Neural Child Development System documentation. This system simulates child development through advanced neural networks and psychological modeling.

## Overview

The Neural Child Development System is a sophisticated AI platform that models child development from newborn to mature stages, incorporating:

- Psychological Components (attachment, theory of mind, emotional regulation)
- Developmental Stage Progression
- Interactive Learning and Adaptation
- Real-time Monitoring and Analysis
