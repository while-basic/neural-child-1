# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and run the Neural Child Development System.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)
- 8GB+ RAM
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-child.git
cd neural-child
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic Configuration

1. Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml`:
```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

2. Edit `config.yaml` to configure:
   - Model parameters
   - Development stages
   - Training settings
   - Interface options

## Quick Start

1. Start the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Access the interface at `http://localhost:8501`

## Core Concepts

### Development Stages
The system models child development through distinct stages:
- Newborn (0-3 months)
- Early Infancy (3-6 months)
- Late Infancy (6-12 months)
- Toddler (1-3 years)
- Early Childhood (3-6 years)

### Psychological Components
Key psychological systems include:
- Attachment System
- Theory of Mind
- Emotional Regulation
- Defense Mechanisms

### Training and Learning
The system uses:
- Autonomous Learning
- Supervised Training
- Interactive Learning
- Memory Replay

## Basic Usage

### Interacting with the Child Model
1. Select a development stage
2. Choose interaction type
3. Monitor responses and development
4. Track emotional states

### Saving and Loading States
```python
# Save current state
model.save_checkpoint('checkpoint_name')

# Load previous state
model.load_checkpoint('checkpoint_name')
```

### Monitoring Progress
- Use the dashboard for real-time metrics
- Track developmental milestones
- Monitor emotional development
- Analyze learning progress

## Next Steps

- Read the [Architecture Guide](../architecture/index.md)
- Explore [Example Scripts](../examples/index.md)
- Review [API Documentation](../api/index.md)
- Learn about [Advanced Features](advanced-features.md)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. GPU Memory Errors
   - Reduce batch size in config
   - Use CPU-only mode

2. Training Instability
   - Adjust learning rate
   - Check data quality
   - Modify model parameters

3. Interface Issues
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check port availability
   - Verify dependencies
