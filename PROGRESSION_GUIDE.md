## Accelerated Development (500% Speed)

### Speed Optimization Techniques
1. **Parallel Skill Development**
   - Combine multiple interaction types in single sessions
   - Example: `[TALK]` while doing `[COMFORT]` to develop both voice recognition and motor skills
   - Stack complementary interactions for multiplicative effects

2. **Intensity Optimization**
   - Increase interaction duration to 45-60 seconds
   - Maintain higher emotional engagement
   - Use more complex stimuli within stage limits

3. **Efficient Interaction Cycles**
   - Reduce breaks between interactions
   - Maintain optimal emotional state (65-85% range)
   - Quick transitions between different interaction types

4. **Strategic Skill Targeting**
   - Focus on highest-weight metrics first
   - Chain related skills for synergistic development
   - Prioritize foundational skills that unlock others

### Acceleration Safety Checklist
✓ Monitor emotional stability every 3-5 interactions
✓ Check for signs of overstimulation every 10 minutes
✓ Ensure foundational skills are solid before advancing
✓ Maintain balanced development across all metrics
✓ Document any warning signs or adverse reactions
✓ Adjust speed based on individual response patterns

### Recovery Protocols
1. **If Critical Warning Detected:**
   - Immediately reduce speed to 100%
   - Focus on emotional regulation
   - Return to last stable skill level

2. **If Warning Level Reached:**
   - Reduce speed to 200%
   - Increase positive reinforcement
   - Review foundational skills

3. **After Warning Resolution:**
   - Gradually increase speed (50% increments)
   - Monitor for recurring issues
   - Document successful acceleration patterns

Remember to:
- Never sacrifice emotional stability for speed
- Maintain balanced development across all areas
- Document all warning signs and responses
- Adjust acceleration based on individual capacity
- Prioritize long-term development over short-term gains
